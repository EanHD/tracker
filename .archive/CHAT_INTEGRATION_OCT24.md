# Chat Integration Improvements - October 24, 2025

## Overview
Enhanced chat system to provide personalized, context-aware conversations by integrating user profile, recent entries, and specific entry details.

## Changes Made

### 1. Continue Conversation from Entry View ‚úÖ
**Location**: `src/tracker/cli/tui/app.py`

After viewing an entry (via View or Search), users now see:
```
üí¨ Continue conversation about this entry? [y/n] (n):
```

- Creates or opens existing entry-linked chat
- Automatically loads entry context into conversation
- Shows existing messages if conversation already exists
- Seamless integration with chat system

### 2. Continue Conversation from Retry Command ‚úÖ
**Location**: `src/tracker/cli/commands/retry.py`

After successful feedback regeneration:
```
üí¨ Continue conversation about this entry? [y/n] (n):
```

- Offers to start/continue entry conversation
- Loads chat directly from CLI
- Useful for discussing the new feedback

### 3. Fixed "n" New Chat Error in TUI ‚úÖ
**Location**: `src/tracker/cli/tui/app.py`

**Problem**: Selecting "n" to create new chat returned "Error:"

**Fix**: 
- Replaced `CliRunner` approach with direct function call
- Created `_start_new_chat()` helper function
- Now prompts: "What's on your mind?"
- Creates standalone chat properly

### 4. Enhanced Chat Context System ‚úÖ
**Location**: `src/tracker/services/chat.py`

**Previous Context**: Only basic profile and entry data

**New Enhanced Context**:

#### For All Chats:
- **User Profile**:
  - Display name
  - Communication style preference
  - Primary goals
  - Stress triggers
  - Coping strategies

#### For Standalone Chats:
- **Recent Activity Summary** (Last 7 days):
  - Number of entries logged
  - Average stress level
  - Total income vs expenses
  - Net balance

#### For Entry-Linked Chats:
- **Detailed Entry Context**:
  - Full financial breakdown (income, expenses, net)
  - Work metrics (hours worked)
  - Stress level
  - Priority task
  - Complete journal notes

### 5. Improved System Prompt ‚úÖ

**New System Message**:
```
You are Tracker, a supportive AI companion helping the user with their 
daily reflections, wellbeing, and personal growth. Be empathetic, insightful, 
and encouraging. Use the provided context about their profile and journal 
entries to personalize your responses.
```

- Consistent branding ("Tracker" not "AI Assistant")
- Emphasizes personalization using context
- Clear role definition

## New Helper Functions

### `_start_entry_chat(entry_id: int)`
- Gets or creates chat linked to specific entry
- Displays existing messages
- Starts interactive chat loop
- Used after viewing entries or running retry

### `_start_new_chat()`
- Creates new standalone chat with custom title
- Prompts "What's on your mind?"
- Includes recent activity context
- Fixed the "n" error in TUI

### `_chat_loop_native(console, chat_service, chat_id: int)`
- Interactive chat loop for TUI
- Handles exit, clear, keyboard interrupt
- Shows "Tracker" instead of "AI Assistant"
- Returns to menu on exit
