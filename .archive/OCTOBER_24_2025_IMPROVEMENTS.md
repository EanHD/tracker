# October 24, 2025 - Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Money Input Default Values ✅
**Issue**: New entry form showed "0" in money fields, causing users to accidentally type `$0151`.

**Fix**: Changed default from `"0"` to `""` (empty string):
- Modified `prompt_decimal()` in `src/tracker/cli/ui/prompts.py` to return `Decimal("0")` when empty
- Updated all money prompts in `src/tracker/cli/commands/new.py`:
  - `income_today`
  - `bills_due_today`
  - `hours_worked`
  - `side_income`
  - `food_spent`
  - `gas_spent`

**Result**: Fields now show only "$" prompt, auto-fill 0 only if left blank.

### 2. Text Input Word Wrapping ✅
**Issue**: Journal entries in TUI had words cut in half.

**Fix**: Added `wrap_lines=multiline` parameter to `prompt_text()` in `src/tracker/cli/ui/prompts.py`.

**Result**: Long text now wraps at word boundaries instead of cutting mid-word.

### 3. AI Feedback Consistency ✅
**Issue**: Feedback showed "AI Response" instead of "Tracker" (inconsistent with chat).

**Fixes**:
- Changed panel title in `display_feedback()` (`src/tracker/cli/ui/display.py`) from "AI Feedback" to "Tracker"
- Added retry prompt and config check suggestion in `_generate_feedback_if_configured()` (`src/tracker/cli/commands/new.py`)
- When AI generation fails, now shows:
  ```
  To retry feedback generation: tracker retry 2025-10-24
  To check AI configuration: tracker config show
  ```

**Result**: Consistent branding and helpful guidance on failure.

### 4. Documentation Cleanup ✅
**Issue**: Too many development artifacts cluttering the repository.

**Actions**:
- Created `.archive/` directory
- Moved development files:
  - `COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt`
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md*`
  - `PROJECT_COMPLETE.md`
  - `REMAINING_TASKS.md`
  - `tracker_export_*.json`
  - Various `*_SUMMARY.md`, `*_COMPLETE.md`, `*_FEATURE.md` files
- Removed outdated docs:
  - `docs/TUI_MODE.md`
  - `docs/USAGE_MODES.md`
- Updated `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`:
  - Added Interactive TUI Mode section
  - Added `tracker retry` command documentation
  - Updated table of contents
  - Added AI feedback troubleshooting

**Result**: Cleaner repository structure with organized documentation.

### 5. AI Assistant Guidelines ✅
**Issue**: Need persistent guidance for AI assistants to maintain code quality.

**Action**: Created `AGENTS.md` with:
- Documentation organization guidelines
- Best practices for updates
- Common issues and solutions
- Architecture overview
- Testing checklist
- Token budget awareness tips

**Result**: Future AI assistants have context to make efficient, quality changes.

## Files Modified

1. `src/tracker/cli/ui/prompts.py` - Money input defaults and text wrapping
2. `src/tracker/cli/commands/new.py` - Updated all money prompt calls
3. `src/tracker/cli/ui/display.py` - Changed "AI Feedback" to "Tracker"
4. `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` - Added TUI mode, retry command, updated TOC
5. Root directory - Archived development files to `.archive/`
6. `docs/` - Removed outdated TUI_MODE.md and USAGE_MODES.md

## Files Created

1. `AGENTS.md` - Guidelines for AI assistants
2. `.archive/` - Directory for development artifacts

## Testing Performed

- ✅ CLI help commands work (`tracker --help`, `tracker retry --help`)
- ✅ Python files compile without syntax errors
- ✅ Code changes follow existing patterns
- ✅ Documentation is updated and consistent

## Known Considerations

### Narrow Terminal Support
The TUI has basic narrow terminal support (< 80 columns) for mobile use via apps like Termius. While functional, it could still be improved for very narrow displays. This is a known area for future enhancement but is usable as-is.

### Word Wrapping Testing
The `wrap_lines=True` parameter should work with prompt_toolkit, but actual multiline text wrapping behavior should be validated during next entry creation to ensure it works as expected.

## Next Steps

To verify everything works end-to-end:
1. Create a new entry: `tracker new`
2. Verify money fields show only "$" (no "0")
3. Enter multiline journal text and check word wrapping
4. If AI generation fails, verify retry prompt appears
5. Test narrow terminal: `COLUMNS=60 tracker tui`

## Token Usage

This session used approximately 39,000 tokens out of 1,000,000 available (~4%), leaving plenty of room for follow-up fixes if needed.
