# User Profile & Context System - Complete Implementation âœ…

## What Was Built

A comprehensive **User Profile & Context System** that transforms Tracker's AI feedback from generic to deeply personalized. Users can share as much or as little context as they're comfortable withâ€”and the AI adapts accordingly.

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… Core Components

1. **Enhanced Database Model** (`src/tracker/core/models.py`)
   - UserProfile with encrypted fields for sensitive data
   - Three privacy levels: basic, personal, deep
   - Automatic streak tracking
   - Monthly check-in support

2. **Profile Service** (`src/tracker/services/profile_service.py`)
   - Full CRUD operations for profile data
   - Privacy-aware context generation
   - Automatic entry stats tracking
   - Monthly check-in logic

3. **CLI Commands** (`src/tracker/cli/commands/profile.py`)
   - `tracker profile setup` - Interactive wizard
   - `tracker profile view` - Display profile
   - `tracker profile update` - Modify sections
   - `tracker profile checkin` - Monthly refresh

4. **AI Integration** 
   - All AI clients updated (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Local)
   - Profile context enriches prompts automatically
   - Tone adaptation based on user preference
   - Context-aware insights and reminders

5. **Database Migration** (Applied âœ…)
   - Safely migrated from old schema to new encrypted structure
   - Backward compatible with existing data

### âœ… Documentation

- `USER_PROFILE_SYSTEM.md` - Comprehensive guide
- `PROFILE_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation details
- `PROFILE_QUICK_REF.md` - Quick reference
- Updated `README.md` with profile info

## Key Features

### ðŸ”’ Privacy-First Design
- **User controls depth**: basic â†’ personal â†’ deep
- **Field-level encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Local-only storage**: Nothing leaves your database
- **Gradual opt-in**: Works fine without profile

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Personalization
Profile context includes:
- Preferred name and communication tone
- Entry streak and stats
- Stress triggers and calming activities
- Work schedule and pay cycle (personal mode)
- Bills, debts, and goals (personal mode)
- AI-detected patterns (deep mode)

### ðŸ¤– AI Integration
The AI now:
- Addresses you by name
- Adapts tone to your preference (casual/professional/encouraging/stoic)
- References your goals and progress
- Provides schedule-aware reminders
- Recognizes patterns in your behavior
- Offers context-specific encouragement

## Example Impact

### Before Profile
```
You spent $45 on food today. Good job logging your entry!
```

### After Profile (Personal Mode, 12-day streak, goal: $5k emergency fund)
```
Hey Sarah! ðŸŒŸ

12 days in a rowâ€”you're crushing it! I know tight finances have been 
stressing you out (especially with that rent coming up), but look at 
what you did today: minimal spending, solid work hours, and you kept 
stress at a 6 despite everything.

Your $5k emergency fund is 60% there. At this rate, you'll hit it by 
Mayâ€”right when you wanted to. One day at a time, one entry at a time. 
You're doing amazing. ðŸ’ª
```

## Usage

### Initial Setup (2-5 minutes)
```bash
tracker profile setup
```

### Daily Usage
```bash
tracker new  # Profile context automatically used
```

### Maintenance
```bash
tracker profile view      # See your profile
tracker profile update    # Update sections
tracker profile checkin   # Monthly refresh (every 30 days)
```

## Architecture

```
User creates entry
    â†“
FeedbackService.generate_feedback()
    â†“
ProfileService.get_ai_context(user_id)
    â†“
Returns {nickname, tone, streak, goals, work, financial, ...}
    â†“
AI builds personalized prompt
    â†“
Generate feedback with user's preferred tone
    â†“
ProfileService.update_entry_stats() (auto-tracks streak)
    â†“
User sees personalized, context-aware feedback
```

## Testing Checklist

- âœ… Migration runs successfully
- âœ… Profile commands work (`setup`, `view`, `update`, `checkin`)
- âœ… Profile service can encrypt/decrypt data
- âœ… AI clients accept profile_context parameter
- âœ… Imports work correctly
- âœ… Documentation comprehensive

## Future Enhancements (Design Ready)

The system is architected to support:

1. **AI Planning Mode**
   ```bash
   tracker profile simulate "pay $50 extra on car note"
   ```

2. **Visual Dashboard**
   - Net worth trends
   - Cash flow graphs
   - Debt timelines
   - Goal progress bars

3. **Smart Reminders**
   - "Payday tomorrow! Pre-plan?"
   - "Rent due in 3 days"
   - "Bill clustering detected"

4. **Pattern Insights**
   - "You log less when stress hits 8+"
   - "Coffee spending correlates with low sleep"
   - "Gym days = lower stress next day"

5. **Goal Integration**
   - Visual progress tracking
   - Emotional correlation ("Under budget 3 weeks â†’ stress down 20%")
   - Milestone celebrations

## Migration Path for Users

Existing users:
1. Continue using Tracker normally (basic mode auto-enabled)
2. Run `tracker profile setup` whenever ready
3. Gradually increase privacy: basic â†’ personal â†’ deep
4. No breaking changes, fully backward compatible

## Security

- âœ… **AES encryption** for all sensitive fields
- âœ… **Local-only storage** - no cloud uploads
- âœ… **User-controlled sharing** via privacy levels
- âœ… **Same encryption** as existing financial fields

## Success Metrics

Once deployed, track:
- % of users setting up profiles
- Privacy level distribution (basic/personal/deep)
- Entry streak improvements
- User feedback on AI quality
- Monthly check-in completion rate

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to production** - System is production-ready
2. **User onboarding** - Prompt new users to set up profile
3. **Gather feedback** - See what users like/dislike
4. **Iterate** - Build future enhancements based on usage

## Developer Notes

### Adding New Profile Fields

1. Add encrypted column to `UserProfile` model
2. Add getter/setter properties
3. Update `ProfileService` methods
4. Create migration
5. Update CLI commands
6. Update documentation

### Testing

```bash
# Test imports
python -c "from tracker.services.profile_service import ProfileService; print('âœ…')"

# Test commands
tracker profile --help
tracker profile view

# Test with isolated database
TRACKER_DATABASE_PATH=test.db tracker profile setup
```

## Credits

Designed and implemented based on brainstormed ideas for making Tracker's feedback more personal, human, and useful by giving the AI richer context about users.

## Conclusion

The User Profile & Context System is **fully implemented and ready to use**. It transforms Tracker from a simple logging tool into a personalized companion that truly knows and supports you.

The more you share, the smarter it getsâ€”but you control exactly how much context you're comfortable sharing. Start with basic mode, level up when ready.

**Your personalized journey starts with: `tracker profile setup`** ðŸš€
