# Tracker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User Privacy & Data Security

Financial data is highly sensitive personal information that MUST be protected with the highest standards of security and privacy. All principles below are NON-NEGOTIABLE:

- User financial data MUST be stored with encryption at rest
- API endpoints MUST require authentication for all data operations
- Personal data MUST NOT be shared with third parties without explicit user consent
- AI agent integrations MUST operate under strict data access controls
- Audit logging MUST track all data access and modifications
- Data retention policies MUST be clearly documented and enforced

**Rationale**: Users tracking financial struggles, debt, and stress levels are entrusting extremely personal information to this system. A single breach or privacy violation could cause severe financial and emotional harm.

### II. API-First Architecture

All core functionality MUST be accessible via well-documented API endpoints before UI implementation. This ensures automation, testing, and third-party integration capabilities are first-class features, not afterthoughts.

- Every user-facing feature MUST have a corresponding API endpoint
- API contracts MUST be versioned and backward compatible within major versions
- API responses MUST follow consistent JSON structure with proper error handling
- API documentation MUST include example requests/responses and error codes
- Authentication tokens MUST have appropriate scopes and expiration policies

**Rationale**: The feature explicitly requires external AI agent connectivity. API-first design ensures the platform is integration-ready from day one and enables automated workflows.

### III. Resilient AI Integration

AI feedback generation is a value-add feature but MUST NOT block core data capture functionality. The system MUST gracefully handle AI service failures, latency, and unavailability.

- Entry submission MUST succeed even if AI service is unavailable
- AI feedback MUST be generated asynchronously with retry logic
- System MUST provide clear status indicators (pending, completed, failed)
- Failed AI operations MUST be queued for retry with exponential backoff
- Users MUST be able to access and edit entries regardless of AI status
- AI service errors MUST NOT cause data loss or corruption

**Rationale**: Motivational feedback is important but secondary to reliable data capture. A user's financial tracking habit should not be disrupted by external AI service issues.

### IV. Progressive Enhancement

Features MUST be prioritized and implemented as independently testable slices that deliver value incrementally. Each priority level MUST be fully functional before moving to the next.

- P1 features MUST be fully tested and deployable before P2 work begins
- Each user story MUST be independently testable without dependencies on lower-priority features
- Core data capture (P1) MUST work without AI feedback (also P1) being complete
- API functionality MUST be validated with automated integration tests
- Manual UI and automated API paths MUST both be tested for feature parity

**Rationale**: Enables rapid iteration, early user feedback, and minimizes risk of scope creep. Users get value sooner, and each release is a complete, usable product.

### V. Specification-Driven Development

All features MUST be fully specified before implementation begins. Specifications MUST be validated for completeness, clarity, and testability using the quality checklist process.

- Specifications MUST pass all checklist validation items before planning
- Requirements MUST be testable and unambiguous (no vague language)
- Success criteria MUST be measurable and technology-agnostic
- Implementation MUST NOT begin until spec is approved and clarifications resolved
- Changes to requirements during implementation MUST update the spec first
- Specs MUST remain living documents updated to reflect actual implementation

**Rationale**: Prevents scope drift, reduces rework, ensures testability, and maintains alignment between what was requested and what was delivered.

## Data Handling Standards

### Validation & Constraints

- Date fields MUST validate against ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Numeric fields MUST support negative values and 2 decimal places precision
- Stress level MUST be constrained to values 1-10
- One entry per user per date MUST be enforced at database constraint level
- Field-level validation errors MUST provide specific, actionable messages
- Required vs optional fields MUST be clearly documented and enforced

### Auditability

- All entry create/update operations MUST record immutable timestamps
- Edit history MUST preserve original values before modification
- API access logs MUST include user ID, timestamp, endpoint, and status
- Failed authentication attempts MUST be logged for security monitoring
- AI feedback generation attempts MUST be tracked with status and duration

## Development Workflow

### Feature Lifecycle

All features follow this mandatory workflow:

1. **Specify**: Create spec using `/specify` - validate with quality checklist
2. **Clarify**: Resolve any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers if present
3. **Plan**: Create implementation plan with `/plan` once spec approved
4. **Implement**: Build according to plan with tests-first approach
5. **Validate**: Verify against acceptance scenarios from spec

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests MUST cover all business logic paths
- Integration tests MUST validate API contracts and data persistence
- Edge cases identified in spec MUST have corresponding test cases
- Tests MUST be written before implementation (test-first)
- All tests MUST pass before feature is considered complete
- Negative test cases MUST verify proper error handling

### Code Quality Standards

- Code MUST be self-documenting with clear variable/function names
- Complex business logic MUST have explanatory comments
- Dead code and commented-out sections MUST be removed
- Dependencies MUST be minimized - evaluate necessity before adding
- Security vulnerabilities MUST be addressed immediately upon discovery

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and conventions. All implementation decisions MUST align with these principles. When conflicts arise, constitution principles take precedence.

### Amendment Process

- Amendments MUST be proposed with clear rationale and impact analysis
- Version MUST increment according to semantic versioning:
  - MAJOR: Principle removal or backward-incompatible changes
  - MINOR: New principles or material guidance additions
  - PATCH: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic fixes
- Affected templates and documentation MUST be updated in sync
- Sync Impact Report MUST document all changes and propagation status

### Compliance & Review

- All feature specs MUST be reviewed against constitutional principles
- Implementation plans MUST explicitly address security and privacy requirements
- Code reviews MUST verify adherence to API-first and resilience principles
- Regular audits MUST verify data handling standards are being followed
