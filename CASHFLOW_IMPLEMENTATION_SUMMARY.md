# Cash Flow Loop Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive, provider-agnostic cash-flow loop tracking system for the Tracker application. This feature allows users to model any repeating money loop (payday advances, tool truck payments, BNPL, etc.) without hard-coding brand names.

## Implementation Date
October 27, 2025

## What Was Built

### 1. Data Model (src/tracker/core/models.py)

**New Model: `CashFlowEvent`**
- Tracks discrete money events with flexible providers and categories
- Fields:
  - `event_date`: ISO date
  - `event_type`: income|bill|transfer|spend|advance|repayment|fee
  - `provider`: User-defined (e.g., 'acorns_checking', 'tool_truck', 'advance_app')
  - `category`: e.g., 'gas', 'food', 'rent', 'subscription'
  - `amount_cents`: INTEGER (positive = outflow, negative = inflow)
  - `account`: Optional account tracking
  - `memo`: Additional context
- Sign convention: Positive = outflow (expense), Negative = inflow (income)
- Efficient indexes for queries

**Migration:** `ef5ee746e09b_add_cash_flow_events_table.py`
- Creates cash_flow_events table
- Adds 6 indexes for efficient queries
- Idempotent and reversible

### 2. Configuration System

**File:** `src/tracker/services/cashflow_config.py`

**TOML-based Configuration** (`~/.config/tracker/cashflow.toml`):
- Payroll cadence settings (Thursday payroll by default)
- User-defined provider registry (no brand lock-in)
- Loop definitions for paired event analysis
- Weekly budget defaults

**Key Features:**
- Auto-creates default config on first use
- Supports dotted-key access for updates
- Type-safe dataclasses for config structure

**Default Configuration Includes:**
- Example providers: advance_app, tool_truck
- Example loops: pay_advance_loop, tool_truck_loop
- Configurable essentials categories

### 3. Analytics Engine

**File:** `src/tracker/services/finance/loops.py`

**Pure Functions for Analysis:**
- `get_week_window()`: Calculate week boundaries based on payroll cadence
- `get_events_in_range()`: Query events with filters
- `sum_events()`: Aggregate event amounts
- `is_event_in_loop()`: Loop membership detection
- `filter_loop_events()`: Extract loop-specific events
- `summarize_loops()`: Per-loop activity summaries
- `end_of_week_cash()`: Calculate end-of-week balance with/without loops
- `get_loop_delta_vs_prior_week()`: Week-over-week comparisons
- `calculate_weeks_without_loop()`: Streak tracking
- `get_essentials_total()`: Essential spending aggregation
- `format_cents_to_usd()`: Pretty formatting

**Key Analytics:**
- Shows cash with vs without loops (exposes "loop strain")
- Tracks usage trends week-over-week
- Calculates streaks without loop usage
- Identifies essential vs discretionary spending

### 4. CLI Commands

**Command Group:** `tracker cashflow`

**Subcommands:**

1. **`add-event`**: Record individual cash flow events
   - Supports all event types
   - Optional categorization and provider tracking
   - Backdating support

2. **`week`**: Weekly summary with loop analysis
   - Income totals
   - Essentials breakdown by category
   - Per-loop summaries (inflows, outflows, net)
   - Week-over-week deltas
   - End-of-week cash with/without loops
   - Loop strain calculation

3. **`month`**: Monthly report with extended analysis
   - Loop overview (weeks used, totals, strain)
   - Streak tracking (current and best)
   - Top spending categories
   - Actionable recommendations

4. **`import`**: Bulk CSV import
   - Format: date,type,provider,category,amount,account,memo
   - Error reporting
   - Transaction validation

5. **`config-show`**: Display current configuration
   - Shows all providers, loops, and settings
   - File location reference

6. **`config-set`**: Update configuration values
   - Dotted-key notation
   - Type-aware parsing (bool, float, int, string)

### 5. Documentation

**File:** `docs/CASHFLOW_GUIDE.md`

**Comprehensive Guide Including:**
- Core concepts explanation
- Getting started tutorial
- Configuration reference
- CLI command documentation
- Real-world use cases and examples
- Analytics explanation
- CSV import guide
- Troubleshooting tips
- Sign convention reference

### 6. Unit Tests

**File:** `tests/services/finance/test_loops.py`

**Test Coverage:**
- Week window calculations
- Event summation
- Loop detection logic
- End-of-week cash calculations
- Formatting functions
- With/without loops scenarios

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Provider Agnostic
No brand names are hardcoded. Users define their own providers in the config, making the system universally applicable.

### 2. Thursday Payroll Cadence
Default week runs Fri→Thu to align with Thursday-night payroll, but fully configurable.

### 3. Consistent Sign Convention
- Positive = Outflow (expenses)
- Negative = Inflow (income)

This makes calculations intuitive and consistent across all event types.

### 4. Loop Strain Visibility
The "with vs without loops" comparison clearly shows the financial impact of borrowing/advance behavior.

### 5. Pure Analytics Functions
All analytics logic is in pure functions that don't depend on CLI or database directly, making them testable and reusable.

### 6. TTS-Friendly Output
No fancy box art or complex layouts - all output is screen-reader friendly.

## Technical Stack

- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite
- **Migrations**: Alembic
- **CLI**: Click
- **Config**: Python's built-in tomllib (Python 3.11+)
- **Testing**: Pytest framework (tests provided)
- **Output**: Rich console with accessibility support

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ Users can define any provider(s) via config
✅ Providers can be grouped into named loops
✅ `week` and `month` reports show with/without loop cash
✅ Per-loop deltas displayed
✅ Works with empty DB
✅ Works with no loops configured (degrades gracefully)
✅ No hard-coded brand names (examples only in docs/tests)
✅ Commands run on empty and populated databases
✅ End-to-end implementation complete
✅ Functions are small, documented, and testable
✅ Migration is idempotent
✅ Sign convention documented and consistent

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

The following items from the original spec were deprioritized:

1. **`set balance` command**: Not critical for initial release
2. **`plan payday` command**: Advanced feature for future iteration
3. **Backfill migration**: Low priority - users can manually import historical data

These can be added in future updates based on user feedback.

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a pure addition to the Tracker app. Existing functionality remains unchanged.

## Migration Notes for Users

1. Run `tracker init` if not already initialized
2. Run `alembic upgrade head` to create the cash_flow_events table (or it will auto-run on next app start)
3. Run `tracker cashflow config-show` to generate default config
4. Customize `~/.config/tracker/cashflow.toml` with your providers and loops
5. Start recording events with `tracker cashflow add-event`

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient indexes on `user_id`, `event_date`, `event_type`, and `provider`
- Composite indexes on `(user_id, event_date)` and `(event_type, provider)`
- All amounts stored as integers (cents) to avoid float precision issues
- Pure functions enable caching opportunities in the future

## Security

- Amount data stored as integers (no sensitive float operations)
- Config file stored in user's config directory with appropriate permissions
- No credentials or API keys involved
- Database follows existing Tracker encryption patterns for sensitive fields

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready cash flow loop tracking system that is:
- Flexible (user-defined providers)
- Powerful (comprehensive analytics)
- Accessible (TTS-friendly, clear output)
- Maintainable (pure functions, good separation of concerns)
- Documented (extensive user guide)
- Tested (unit tests provided)

Users can now track any repeating money loop and see its true impact on their finances, helping them make informed decisions about advance apps, auto-debits, BNPL, and other financial arrangements.
