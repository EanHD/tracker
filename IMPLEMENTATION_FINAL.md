# Final Implementation Summary

## What's Been Built (Core Engines)

### ✅ Complete Systems
1. **cashflow_config.py** - Config with your real values (Thursday $1,300, etc.)
2. **finance/forecast.py** - Daily predictions with reserve-then-clear
3. **natural_commands.py** - NL parser + entity resolver + diff/audit

### 🔨 What's Needed (Surface Layer)

To complete the product, need:

1. **CLI Commands** (~2 hours)
   - `tracker adjust`
   - `tracker scan-entry`  
   - `tracker review-week`
   - `tracker revert`
   - `tracker forecast`
   - `tracker setup-weekly`

2. **TUI Integration** (~2 hours)
   - Natural Commands panel
   - Inline suggestions in New Entry
   - Forecast view
   - Keybindings

3. **Pretty Formatting** (~30 min)
   - render_diff()
   - render_forecast()
   - Currency formatting

4. **Tests** (~1 hour)
   - Parser tests
   - Safety workflow tests
   - Integration tests

5. **Docs** (~30 min)
   - Update guides
   - Add examples

**Total remaining: ~6 hours**

## Current State

All three core engines are implemented and functional:
- Config loads your real values
- Forecast engine has all logic (reserve-then-clear, gas frequency)
- Natural commands parser works with pattern matching

What's missing is the user-facing surface (CLI commands, TUI panels, pretty output).

## Files Structure

```
✅ DONE:
src/tracker/services/
  ├── cashflow_config.py
  ├── natural_commands.py
  └── finance/
      ├── forecast.py
      └── loops.py

⏳ TODO:
src/tracker/cli/commands/
  └── cashflow.py              (add: adjust, scan-entry, etc.)

src/tracker/cli/tui/
  └── app.py                   (add: Natural Commands panel)

src/tracker/ui/
  └── formatters.py            (new: render_diff, render_forecast)

tests/services/
  └── test_natural_commands.py (new)
```

## Implementation Plan

Due to token limits, I've created complete implementations for:
- Core engines (✅ done)
- Status documentation (✅ done)

To finish, you or another session should:
1. Add CLI commands to cashflow.py using the examples in NATURAL_COMMANDS_STATUS.md
2. Add TUI panels using Textual framework (match existing app.py patterns)
3. Create formatters.py with table rendering
4. Write tests following examples in the status docs
5. Update README with usage examples

All the hard logic is done - just needs UI/formatting layer!

**Status:** Core complete (100%), Surface layer pending (0%)
**Estimated completion:** 6 hours
