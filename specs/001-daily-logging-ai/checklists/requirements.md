# Specification Quality Checklist: Daily Logging App with AI Agent Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Review**: 
- Specification focuses on business value and user needs without prescribing technical solutions
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete and detailed

**Requirement Completeness Review**:
- All 23 functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentages, success rates)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic, focusing on user outcomes
- 5 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios covering all major flows
- Edge cases comprehensively identified including date validation, service availability, data limits, and concurrency
- Scope clearly defined with detailed "Out of Scope" section
- Assumptions documented to provide context for design decisions

**Feature Readiness Review**:
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios prioritized (P1-P3) as independently testable slices
- Core MVP identified (P1 stories: entry submission and AI feedback)
- No implementation leakage detected (no mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or databases)

**Specification Status**: âœ… **READY FOR PLANNING** - All checklist items pass. No clarifications needed.
