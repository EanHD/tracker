# Feature Specification: Daily Logging App with AI Agent Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-daily-logging-ai`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a daily logging app I can connect an ai agent to via api that lets me fill out a list of things daily and get ai feedback for inspiration, motivation, and feel good stuff"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Submit Daily Financial Entry (Priority: P1)

A user with variable income and debt obligations needs to track their daily financial snapshot including cash, income, expenses, and obligations. They open the app, fill out all the financial fields for today's date, add notes about significant events, and submit the entry. The entry is saved and available for review.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition—capturing daily financial data. Without this, the app has no purpose. It's the foundation that all other features build upon.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new daily entry with all fields (date, cash_on_hand, bank_balance, income_today, bills_due_today, debts_total, hours_worked, side_income, food_spent, gas_spent, notes, stress_level, priority) and verifying the entry is saved and retrievable. Delivers immediate value as a financial tracking log.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user opens the app on 2025-10-21, **When** they fill out all financial fields and submit, **Then** the entry is saved with the current date and all field values are stored accurately
2. **Given** the user has already submitted an entry for today, **When** they attempt to create another entry for the same date, **Then** they are prompted to either edit the existing entry or cancel
3. **Given** the user enters negative values for bank_balance or debts_total, **When** they submit, **Then** the system accepts and saves these values correctly
4. **Given** the user enters only required fields, **When** they submit, **Then** the entry is saved with blank values for optional fields

---

### User Story 2 - View Historical Entries (Priority: P2)

A user wants to review their financial progress over time. They navigate to a history view where they can see all their previous daily entries listed by date. They can select any entry to view the full details including all financial metrics and notes.

**Why this priority**: Historical data provides context and enables users to identify patterns in their spending, income, and stress levels. This is essential for the app to be more than a single-day tracker.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating multiple entries across different dates and verifying they appear in chronological order with accurate data. Delivers value by enabling pattern recognition and progress tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has created entries for multiple dates, **When** they view the history screen, **Then** all entries are displayed in reverse chronological order (newest first)
2. **Given** the user views the history, **When** they select a specific date entry, **Then** all field values for that date are displayed accurately
3. **Given** the user has no entries yet, **When** they view the history screen, **Then** they see a helpful message prompting them to create their first entry

### User Story 3 - Receive AI Motivational Feedback (Priority: P1)

A user submits their daily entry and wants encouragement and perspective on their financial situation. The AI agent analyzes their entry (including financial metrics, stress level, and notes) and provides personalized motivational feedback that acknowledges their challenges, celebrates wins, and offers perspective on their progress.

**Why this priority**: This is the differentiation factor mentioned in the feature description—"ai feedback for inspiration, motivation, and feel good stuff." This transforms a simple tracker into an emotional support tool, which is the unique value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting an entry and verifying that AI-generated feedback is returned and displayed. Delivers value by providing emotional support and perspective immediately after data entry.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user submits a daily entry with moderate stress_level (5/10) and positive income_today, **When** they complete submission, **Then** the AI generates encouraging feedback acknowledging their hard work
2. **Given** a user submits an entry showing progress toward their priority goal (e.g., debt reduction), **When** feedback is generated, **Then** the AI highlights this positive trend
3. **Given** a user submits an entry with high stress_level (8/10) and challenging numbers, **When** feedback is generated, **Then** the AI provides empathetic, supportive messaging without toxic positivity
4. **Given** the AI service is temporarily unavailable, **When** a user submits an entry, **Then** the entry is saved successfully and the user is notified that feedback will be generated when available

---

### User Story 4 - Access via API for External Agents (Priority: P2)

An external AI agent or automation system needs to submit entries or retrieve feedback on behalf of the user. The system authenticates via API credentials, submits a properly formatted daily entry payload, and receives confirmation along with AI-generated feedback.

**Why this priority**: This enables automation and integration scenarios mentioned in the feature description ("connect an ai agent to via api"). It extends the app's utility beyond manual entry.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making API calls with valid authentication, submitting entry data, and verifying responses match expected format. Delivers value by enabling automated workflows and integrations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an external system has valid API credentials, **When** it submits a POST request with entry data, **Then** the entry is created and a success response with entry ID is returned
2. **Given** an API request is made without authentication, **When** the system receives the request, **Then** it returns a 401 Unauthorized error
3. **Given** an API request contains invalid data types (e.g., string for numeric field), **When** the system validates the request, **Then** it returns a 400 Bad Request with specific field errors
4. **Given** an API client submits an entry, **When** the entry is saved, **Then** AI feedback is generated and returned in the API response

---

### User Story 5 - Edit Existing Entry (Priority: P3)

A user realizes they made an error in today's entry or forgot to include information. They navigate to the entry, select edit mode, modify the relevant fields, and save the changes. The updated values are stored and AI feedback is regenerated based on the new data.

**Why this priority**: Users make mistakes and situations change throughout the day. This improves data accuracy but is lower priority than core entry and feedback features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an entry, editing specific fields, and verifying changes are saved. Delivers value by ensuring data accuracy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user views an existing entry, **When** they select edit and modify fields, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected immediately
2. **Given** a user edits an entry that previously had AI feedback, **When** they save changes, **Then** new AI feedback is generated based on the updated data
3. **Given** a user begins editing but navigates away, **When** they don't save changes, **Then** the original entry data remains unchanged

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to submit an entry for a future date? The system should either prevent future dates or clearly mark them as projections.
- How does the system handle extremely large debt values (e.g., $999,999)? Ensure fields can accommodate realistic debt amounts without overflow.
- What happens if the AI service takes longer than expected to generate feedback? The entry should be saved immediately, with feedback loading asynchronously.
- How does the system handle missing or blank notes fields? Optional fields should be allowed to be empty without causing errors.
- What happens when a user has spotty internet connection during submission? The system should indicate submission status clearly and queue entries if offline.
- How does the system handle concurrent API requests for the same user/date? Implement appropriate locking or last-write-wins strategy with conflict notification.

### Key Entities

- **Daily Entry**: Represents a single day's financial and wellbeing snapshot. Contains date (unique per user), financial metrics (cash_on_hand, bank_balance, income_today, bills_due_today, debts_total, hours_worked, side_income, food_spent, gas_spent), wellbeing metrics (stress_level, priority), free-form notes, creation timestamp, and associated AI feedback. Each entry belongs to one user.

- **AI Feedback**: Represents motivational and analytical content generated by AI agent in response to a Daily Entry. Contains the generated text message, timestamp of generation, reference to the associated Daily Entry, and feedback status (pending, completed, failed). One AI Feedback per Daily Entry.

- **User**: Represents an individual using the app to track their financial journey. Has authentication credentials, API access tokens (if using API), and relationship to multiple Daily Entries ordered chronologically.

- **API Session**: Represents an authenticated external system connection. Contains credentials, access token, expiration time, and association to a User. Enables external agents to submit entries on behalf of users.

## Assumptions

- Users have basic smartphone or computer literacy and can fill out form fields
- Users want to track daily financial data as a means of improving their financial situation
- AI-generated feedback should be encouraging rather than prescriptive or judgmental
- The target AI agent will be accessible via standard API integration patterns
- Users may have irregular income patterns (side work, variable hours) requiring flexible tracking
- Negative bank balances and high debt amounts are valid and expected use cases for the target user demographic
- Users benefit from both immediate feedback (motivation) and historical pattern analysis
- Privacy and security of financial data is critical—only the user and authorized AI agents should access entries
- The app will be used daily or near-daily, making date-based indexing appropriate
- Users may want to automate entry submission via external tools or integrations (API requirement)
- Mobile-first design is preferred but not exclusive—users may also access from desktop
- The stress_level metric provides valuable context for AI feedback personalization
- Optional notes field allows users to add context that pure numbers cannot capture
