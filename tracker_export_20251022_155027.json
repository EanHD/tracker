        "notes": "Today I woke up late, again and before I left work I was faced with the challenge of deciding whether or not to drive with my o2 sensor disconnected, I ended up leaving it in but going over the hill to get from Los Banos to San Jose, my car was suffocatting and overheating and the oil went thin I thought the car was going to give up, I pulled over and put water in my car once it cooled down and removed the front o2 sensor. I was just worried because the hole was pointed at the radiator fan I wasn't sure if the exhaust was going to melt the plastic. anyway it drove way better. I got to work late but I still clocked myself in for 8 hours. All I did while I was there was remove a transmission. I know I could've got more done. I just get so tired from the 2 hour drive to work. Towards the end of the day I pulled my car in and hallowed the catalytic converter out so that I would make it back home. The fact it drove so well again made me happy. I got home and fed my cats. I wanted to finish this app, I am excited to log myself. I am staying up late though and need to leave early. I will probably set my alarm for 6am instead of 330. I need to get myself organized and go to the gym and get a better routine and learn how to stick to time blocks. at least until I am back on my feat, I feel like I am living on a tightrope. I guess it could be worse though."
